When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To have a safe copy of a project or to colaborate with other people
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To control what and when I do the sync

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

  forks: copy in Github from other person
  clones: to copy from my self localy and remotely
  branches: to keep paralel versions of my job in development

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It helps to don't lose the sync easily and the merges have less conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Agreeing on when each is going to work on the project, using OneDrive or Dropbox

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  When I don't want to break master, specially collaborating with a team. Work in master would make it easy to merge, but it is risky.
